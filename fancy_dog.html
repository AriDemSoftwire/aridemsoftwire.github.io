                <p>An ancient Japanese breed, the Shiba Inu is a little but well-muscled dog once employed as a hunter. Today, 
                    the spirited, good-natured Shiba is the most popular companion dog in Japan. The adaptable Shiba is at home in town or country. 
                    Brought to America from Japan as recently as 60 years ago, Shibas are growing in popularity in the West and are already the most 
                    popular breed in their homeland. Their white markings combined with their coloring (red, red sesame, or black and tan) 
                    and their alert expression and smooth stride makes them almost foxlike. They're sturdy, muscular dogs with a bold, confident personality to match.</p>
                <p>The Shiba Inu dog breed was originally bred to flush birds and small game, and was occasionally used to hunt wild boar. 
                    They’re one of Japan’s six native breeds: Akita (large), Kishu, Hokkaido, Kai, Shikoku (medium), and Shiba (small).</p>
